This data science project focuses on the detection and analysis of thermal anomalies in Antarctica, a crucial region for understanding global climate changes. By using advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, our goal is to identify patterns and unusual variations in the temperatures of this sensitive area.

At this stage of the project, our current focus is on studying the variables that determine the El Ni√±o phenomenon. The next step involves developing an algorithm to predict its occurrence and assess its impact on the planet.
